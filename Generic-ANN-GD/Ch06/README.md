# Working with 1 Hidden Layer of 2 Neurons

Welcome to the project that builds a generic neural network trained using the gradient descent algorithm.

The implementation of this part ends by building the gradient descent that works with a network with any number of inputs, 1 hidden layer with just 2 hidden neurons, and just a single output. The code only works with a single training sample.
