# Working with 2 Hidden Layers of Any Neurons

Welcome to the project that builds a generic neural network trained using the gradient descent algorithm.

The implementation of this part ends by building the a neural network that works with:

1. Any number of inputs.
2. 2 hidden layers with any number of hidden neurons.
3. Just a single output. 
4. A single training sample.
